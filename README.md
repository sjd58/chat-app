## React Native Chat App

## Description

The purpose of this project is to construct a mobile chat app using React native. Users who engage with this app will have a customizable chat interface and will be able to
share images and their location.

## User Stories

As a new user, I want to be able to easily enter a chat room so I can quickly start talking to my friends and family.

As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange the latest stories.

As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what I'm currently doing.

As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am.

As a user, I want to be able to read my messages offline so I can reread conversations at any time.

As a user witha  visual impairment, I want to use a chat app that is compatible with a screen reader so I can engage with a chat interface.

## Key Features

A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen before joining the chat.

A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and submit button.

The chat must provide users with two additional communication features: sending images and location data.

Data gets stored online and offline.
