As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what I'm currently doing.

As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am.

As a user witha  visual impairment, I want to use a chat app that is compatible with a screen reader so I can engage with a chat interface.

## Key Features

A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen before joining the chat.
